# 1. Overview
I have analyzed Blinkit’s dataset to gain insights into various business aspects. The analysis covers key performance indicators such as total sales, average revenue, and average rating, along with number of items sold. Additionally, the study explores sales distribution across different factors like outlet size and outlet location, helping to identify patterns and trends in business performance.

# 2. Business Problem and Objectives
The analysis of Blinkit’s data aims to address several critical business challenges and opportunities:

Store Strategy: Identify the best locations and outlet sizes for opening new stores to optimize product distribution and reach.

Delivery Efficiency: Evaluate delivery performance across different tier cities to ensure faster and more reliable customer service.

Inventory Management: Analyze sales of different items to improve stock management, minimize wastage, and meet customer demand effectively.

Revenue Growth: Discover factors driving total sales, average revenue, and average sales per outlet to boost overall profitability.

Customer Satisfaction: Assess average ratings to understand customer preferences and improve service quality.

Overall, the objective is to leverage data-driven insights to help Blinkit strategize store expansion, streamline operations, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue.

# 3. Dataset Description
The Blinkit dataset contains detailed information about items, outlets, and sales performance. The key columns are:

Item Identifier – Unique ID assigned to each product.

Item Type – Category of the item (e.g., grocery, beverage, household, etc.).

Item Fat Content – Nutritional information related to fat level (e.g., Low Fat, Regular, etc.).

Item Weight – Weight of the item.

Item Visibility – Percentage visibility of the product in the store.

Outlet Identifier – Unique ID for each outlet.

Outlet Establishment Year – Year in which the outlet was established.

Outlet Size – Size of the outlet (Small, Medium, Large).

Outlet Location Type – Tier classification of the city where the outlet is located (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).

Outlet Type – Type of outlet (e.g., Supermarket, Grocery Store, etc.).

Total Sales – Total sales value generated by the item.

Rating – Customer rating of the item/outlet.

This dataset provides both product-level attributes and store-level characteristics, enabling a comprehensive analysis of sales patterns, customer behavior, and outlet performance.

# 4. Methodology
To prepare the dataset for analysis and generate meaningful insights, the following steps were carried out:

1. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.

Standardized categorical fields such as Item Fat Content and Outlet Size.

Verified numerical fields (Sales, Rating, Item Weight, etc.) for outliers and inaccuracies.

2. DAX Measures Creation

In Power BI, several calculated measures were created using DAX to support the analysis:

Total Sales

Total Sales = SUM('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Sales])


Average Sales

Average Sales = AVERAGE('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Sales])


Average Rating

Avg Rating = AVERAGE('BlinkIT Grocery Data'[Rating])


Number of Items

No. of Items = COUNTROWS('BlinkIT Grocery Data')


These measures allowed for flexible aggregations and visualizations of sales, ratings, and item distribution across outlets.

# 5. Insights
Based on the analysis of Blinkit’s dataset, the following key insights were identified:

Product Fat Content: Sales of low-fat content items are significantly higher compared to high-fat content items, indicating a stronger customer preference for healthier options.

City Tier Performance: Tier 3 cities contribute the highest share of sales, showing strong demand and growth opportunities in smaller cities.

Top-Selling Categories: The most frequently purchased products are daily essentials such as fruits & vegetables, snacks, household items, frozen foods, and dairy. Other categories contribute comparatively less to overall sales.

These insights suggest that Blinkit should continue focusing on daily essentials and Tier 3 markets, while also leveraging the health-conscious trend by expanding low-fat product offerings.
